There has been recent interest in using conditional averaging (or filtering) for representing sub-grid scale convection. This would enable net mass flux by sub-grid scale convection. This paper presents a number of advances relevant for using conditional averaging to represent sub-grid scale convection:
● A stable numerical method for solving the conditionally averaged equations in the atmospheric modelling context is presented. 
● Numerical solutions are presented for a variety of warm rising bubbles. 
● When solving the conditionally averaged equations, transfer terms between buoyant and stable fluids are equivalent to convective entrainment, detrainment and convective mass flux. Some novel forms of transfer terms are presented.
● A novel technique for stabilising the conditionally averaged equations is given.
